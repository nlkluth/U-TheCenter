						system that he hopes will change the way students communicate amongst each other. Monte wants to make life on campus easier for all students by providing

                        <p>Omelio's family brought him to America as young child for better opportunities that werenâ€™t available in Jamaica. He was involved in many youth leadership
						and entrepreneurial after school activates that would help in later stages of his life. After graduating high school, and having an unsuccessful first year in
						college, he enlisted into the air force to get further guidance in what he wanted to do. After his military time was cut short due to a medical injury, he went back
						to school to complete his degree in technology - a field he has always loved. Now working with VETransfer, he is able to use his love of technology,
						entrepreneurship drive and Military experience to take his career to the next step: Helping U TheCenter be the next innovation to help individuals.</p>

                        <p>Kierston Ghaznavi has always had an interest in art and illustration. As a child she would get in trouble in school for drawing all over her
						homework. She knew her future career would take her down a creative path. Kierston received her BFA in Graphic Design at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in May 2012. She is most interested in pen and
						vector illustrations as well as typography and branding. She was a part of the design team responsible for the branding and visual look of the
						Design Entrepreneur Showcase for Graphic Design II last semester. In the future, Kierston hopes to contribute to the effort of raising
						awareness about the need for organ and tissue donors in Wisconsin, hopefully working in design locally.</p>

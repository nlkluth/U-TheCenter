                        <p>Omelio's family brought him to America as young child for better opportunities that werenâ€™t available in Jamaica. He was involved in many youth leadership
						and entrepreneurial after school activates that would help in later stages of his life. After graduating high school, and having an unsuccessful first year in
						college, he enlisted into the air force to get further guidance in what he wanted to do. After his military time was cut short due to a medical injury, he went back
						to school to complete his degree in technology - a field he has always loved. Now working with VETransfer, he is able to use his love of technology,
						entrepreneurship drive and Military experience to take his career to the next step: Helping U TheCenter be the next innovation to help individuals.</p>
